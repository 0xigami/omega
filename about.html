                    Inspired by MSCHF's <a href="https://moforgeries.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Forgeries</a>, we acquired the domain forgeries.wtf, set it as our ENS and began bidding on Nouns auctions. People began taking notice, visiting the domain displayed in bid history and being redirected to our twitter account. Our bio read "Noun ___ mixed at random with 999 exact forgeries." We quickly amassed 100 followers and decided we should acquire a Noun.

                    A week or two after we started bidding on Nouns auctions, <a href="https://nouns.wtf/noun/401" target="_blank">we won Noun 401 for 95.32 ETH</a> and joined the daily twitter space, Noun O'clock at The Noun Square. Using a voice modulator, we explained our intentions to effectively give our new Noun away. Our twitter following continued to grow and we began pondering what game theory could be applied and began selling 1000 editions of Noun 401.

                    After much research and contemplation, our founder Gami, decided to reveal himself as the mystery bidder who'd won Noun 401. In <a href="https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1579311847081025536" target="_blank">a tweet thread</a> that quickly reached 125k impressions, he explained the experiment from inception to present day. Only nine days later, Gami was approached by Iain Nash showing interest in developing contracts to deploy the Forgeries concept as a protocol on Ethereum.

                  <a href="https://twitter.com/isiain" target="_blank">Iain</a> began working on the contracts while Gami garnered further interest from reputable developers. He was soon joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/emrecolako" target="_blank">Emre</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanpunzalann" target="_blank">Jordan</a>, and received some helpful feedback from <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmons" target="_blank">Owen</a> of SudoSwap fame. The code has been audited with a <a href="https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-12-forgeries-contest" target="_blank">Code4rena contest</a> and is deployed to mainnet. OMΞGA is the console and Forgeries is our first cartridge.
